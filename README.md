# Javascript Basics
## Variables
Variables are used to store values. They have a name and a value, and are declared using the var keyword. For example:
```
var age = 30;
var weight = 75.5;
var name = "John";
```
## Data types
JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, and Booleans. Numbers can be integers or floating-point values, and can be written with or without a decimal point. Strings are sequences of characters, and are written using single or double quotes. Booleans represent true or false values.

## Operators
JavaScript supports a variety of operators, such as arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /), relational operators (e.g., <, >, ==, !=), and logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !). These operators can be used to perform calculations and compare values.

## Control structures
JavaScript has several control structures that allow you to control the flow of your program. These include if statements, for loops, and while loops. For example:
```
if (age > 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
```
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
```
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```
## Functions
Functions are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of your program. They can take parameters and return a value. For example:
```
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

var result = add(2, 3);
console.log(result); // prints 5
```

These are just a few of the basics of JavaScript. There are many other concepts to learn, such as objects, arrays, and more. I recommend finding a good tutorial or textbook to learn more about the language.
